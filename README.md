## Description
Book Club is a book clubs management web application where the user can explore and join book clubs in order to discuss about books according to their preferences. This is a networking platform where bookworms can share their thoughts about books they have read during meetings (either in person or online) or simply via creating a post in the clubs they belong to. Our AI system will also recommend users books according to the clubs they have joined (the preferences of the club members will affect the recommendations of the system).
##Features

* When the user has signed up and logged into the website they will be redirected to the club home page where:
	** A different book quote will be displayed everyday
	** Profits of reading will be displayed in order to encourage people to read books
* All users can:
	** Create a profile and edit it afterwards
